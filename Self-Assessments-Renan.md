### 1. Functionality
- **Does the code meet the requirements?**
  - [X] Does it implement all specified features you were responsible for?  
  - [X]  Are edge cases handled (e.g., invalid data, duplicates)?  
  - [X] Are there any bugs or unexpected behaviors?  

- **Integration**
  - [X] Does your code work correctly with other parts of the application?  
  - [X] Are inputs and outputs managed appropriately?

### 2. Code Quality
- **Readability**
  - [X] Is your code easy to understand for other developers?  
  - [X] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?  

- **Reusability**
  - [X] Can your code or parts of it be reused elsewhere in the application?  
  - [X] Is logic modular and separated from unrelated concerns?  

- **Comments and Documentation**

### 3. Performance
- **Efficiency**
  - [no] Are there any unnecessary operations or performance bottlenecks?  
  - [no, There wasn't time at some point to optimize] Is the code optimized for larger datasets or high traffic (if applicable)?
