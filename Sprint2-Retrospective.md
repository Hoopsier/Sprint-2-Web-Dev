## Liked
- Working on the frontend UI and turning the ideas into real components.
- Building the restaurant list and improving the responsive layout.
- Team collaboration when we reviewed screens and aligned the UI.

## Learned
- How to structure React components in a cleaner, reusable way.
- How to think about the logic behind restaurant/user registration (prices, delivery distance, and how apps like Wolt/Uber Eats handle it).
- That moving from Figma to code reveals real challenges, and it showed me why planning and details matter.

## Lacked
- More consistent communication and earlier updates when something changed.
- Better time management to avoid rushing small details at the end.

## Longed for
- A more balanced workload across the team.
- More time to polish UI details and prepare smoother integration for the backend.
