Self-Assessment
Member name: Delara Jannat Nipa
Contribution area:Frontend development Home Page, RegistrationView page and Presentation Slides

1. Functionality
   
Does the code meet the requirements?

- Yes. The Home Page and RegistrationView page implement the features assigned to me during this sprint.
- The Home Page displays the main layout, and key content sections as defined in the prototype.

 Does it implement all specified features you were responsible for?
 Are edge cases handled (e.g., invalid data, duplicates)?
 - Yes, i did. Basically follow UI.
 Are there any bugs or unexpected behaviors?
Integration
- No major bugs were identified during testing. 

 Does your code work correctly with other parts of the application?
 Are inputs and outputs managed appropriately?
 
- Since frontend and backend are separated in this sprint, integration was not implemented.
  
  - Components are structured to accept future API responses.

  - Inputs and outputs are handled through controlled components.

  - Form data is stored and managed properly using state.
  
2. Code Quality
   
Readability

 Is your code easy to understand for other developers?
- Component structure is clean and organized.
- Variable and function names are descriptive .
  
 Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?

- Reusability

 Can your code or parts of it be reused elsewhere in the application?
 - Reusable input field patterns can be extracted into shared components in the future.
  
 Is logic modular and separated from unrelated concerns?
Comments and Documentation
- Simple logic is self-explanatory through clear naming.

 Are there comments explaining complex logic?
Complex logic (such as validation conditions) includes short comments.

 Is there documentation for how to use your code unit?
- No external documentation file was created.
  
3. Performance
   
Efficiency
 Are there any unnecessary operations or performance bottlenecks?
 - No unnecessary loops or heavy operations are used.
 Is the code optimized for larger datasets or high traffic (if applicable)?
 - Performance impact is low since the pages are UI-focused.

4. Overall Assessment
   
Strengths
- Clean and structured component design

- Functional form validation

- Responsive layout

- Clear separation between UI and logic

- Presentation slides clearly explain progress and sprint outcomes

Areas for Improvement

- Improve component reusability by creating smaller shared components

- Enhance form validation rules

- Add better error message styling and UX feedback

- Add more detailed inline documentation

List areas where your code could be improved.

- Improve accessibility 
    - ARIA labels
    - keyboard navigation testing
    - Also bakcend

Action Plan

- Refactor repeated input fields into reusable components.

- Improve validation with more detailed error handling.

- Review accessibility standards and update form fields accordingly.

  
5. Additional Notes 
   
Add any other relevant observations or feedback about your contribution.

- Working on the Home Page and RegistrationView helped me strengthen my understanding of component structure, state management, and form handling in frontend development.

Creating the presentation slides also improved my ability to communicate technical progress clearly and confidently.

Overall, I am satisfied with my contribution in this sprint2, and I am motivated to improve code quality and user experience further in the next sprint.
